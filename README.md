# 30DaysOfPython
*Bismiilah* (in the name of Allah). This is my adventurous journey to Python. I am not from a computer science background. So, indeed this is a daring journey for me.:mountain: :wave:
<br\>And I am so happy that I am learning a new skill with which I will be able to help my community *inshaAllah* (if Allah wills). Everyday I will push myself to code and here I will save my progress.<br\>
**Any type of constructive criticism is much welcome as I am a new programmer.** So, feel free to create issues or pull requests. You can also use this repo if you want to do exercises on each topic of ***Python***. I am trying to make it as ordered as possible.<br\><br\>
And, if you like this, give it a **star** :star: to inspire me. :smile: <br\>
<br\>
I am grateful to all of my teachers. Without their inspiration and hard work it wasnâ€™t possible for me to continue. (okay, I hope I will continue, *inshaaAllah*) <br\> <br\>
