# 30DaysOfPython
Bismiilah (in the name of Allah). This is my my journey to Python. Everyday I will push myself to code, and here I will save my progress, inshaaAllah (if Allah wills).<br>
**Any type of constructive criticism is much welcome as I am a new programmer.** So, feel free to create issues or pull requests. You can also use this repo if you want to do exercises on each topic of *Python*. I am trying to make it as ordered as possible. If you like this, give it a star. :smile: <br>
