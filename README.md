# 30DaysOfPython
Bismiilah (in the name of Allah). This is my my journey to Python. Here I will save my progress, inshaaAllah (if Allah wills).<br>
**Any type of constructive criticism is much welcome as I am a new programmer.**
I am grateful to all my teachers.<br> Teachers and resources I have followed:
