# From: Book : Automate the boring stuff with Python;
# Chapter 2: Flow Control
# Topic: Conditionals (if statements)
# Example:
name = "Mary"
password = 'swordfish'
if name == "Mary":
    print("Hello, Mary")
    if password == "swordfish":
        print("Access granted")
    else:
        print("Wrong password")

# example:
name = "Alice"
if name == "Alice":
    print("Hello, Alice")


#3.
name = "Sienna"
if name == "Alice":
    print("hello, Alice")
else:
    print("hello, stranger")

# 4.
name = "Mita"
age = 6
if name == "Alice":
    print("Hi, Alice.")
elif age < 12:
    print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')    # You are not Alice, kiddo.
# The elif clause executes if age < 12 is True and name == 'Alice' is False.

# or,
name = "Alice"
age = 12
if name == "Alice":
    print("Hi, Alice.")                   # Hi, Alice.
elif age < 12:
    print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')    # This line isn't executed.

print()

# When there is a chain of elif statements, only one or none of the clauses will be executed.
# Once one of the statementsâ€™ conditions is found to be True, the rest of the elif clauses are automatically skipped.
name = "Carol"
age = 3000

    print("Hi, ALice.")

    print("Unlike you, Alice is not an undead, immortal vampire.")   # Unlike you, Alice is not an undead, immortal vampire.
elif age > 100:

elif age > 2000:

# else statement: If the conditions in every if and elif statement are False, then the else clause is executed.
