# if case doesn't matter:

# The lower() function doesnâ€™t change the value that was originally stored in car , so you can do this kind of comparison without affecting the original variable:

# Checking for Inequality:

# Using and to Check Multiple Conditions:
# you can check whether two people are both over 21 using the following test:

age_0 = 22
age_1 = 18
print(age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21)      # False

age_1 = 23
print(age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21)      # True
#or,
print((age_0 >= 21) and (age_1 >= 21))  # True

requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']
print("mushrooms" in requested_toppings) # True
print("mushroom" in requested_toppings)  # False
print("pepperoni" in requested_toppings) # False


# Checking Whether a Value Is Not in a List:

user = 'marie'
if user not in banned_users:
    print(user.title() + " ,you can post a response if you wish.")

game_active = True   # checking whether a game is running.
can_edit = False     # checking if a user can edit certain contents on a website.
